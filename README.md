The Online Quiz System is a modern, interactive platform designed to streamline the creation, management, and evaluation of quizzes. It leverages the power of Maps and Lists as data structures to efficiently organize and manage questions, answers, and scores, offering a user-friendly solution for educators, students, and administrators.

In this system, Maps are employed to store and retrieve data such as questions, answers, and user scores. For example, questions can be stored with unique keys such as question IDs, making it easy to search, edit, or retrieve any specific question. Similarly, user scores are maintained using Maps, with user IDs or names serving as keys, enabling quick access to individual performance records. On the other hand, Lists are used to manage ordered data like a sequence of quiz questions, user attempts, or answer options. This combination of Maps and Lists ensures both efficiency and scalability, even when dealing with large datasets.

The system is designed with a focus on user experience and accessibility. Students can attempt quizzes and review their results, while professors can create quizzes, manage question banks, and grade submissions. Administrators oversee the entire platform, ensuring its smooth functioning.

By integrating technology with education, the Online Quiz System promotes interactive learning, enhances the efficiency of assessment processes, and provides real-time feedback to users. It is a reliable and scalable solution for academic institutions, corporate training programs, and competitive exam preparation.
